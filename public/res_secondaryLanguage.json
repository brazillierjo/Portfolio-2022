      "description2": "I started studying after a High School diploma. From little jobs to little jobs, I quickly understood that this context was not enough. I have then re-started my studies at 21 years old for a Licence in e-commerce ! These studies have given me the opportunity to be SEO for 6 years ! This experience has taught me the way of the professional world, the teamwork and the responsibility weight but also the management of a back-office and SEO/SEA. As a SEO, working in close collaboration with developers has given me the chance to dive into this technical world. I offered myself a bootcamp of 6 months for acquiring the basics of web programming and code writing. After this, I have continued my learning in the form of an internship with a Licence Integrator/Developer Web and mobile with React and NodeJs ! Now, I am a freelance developer.",
